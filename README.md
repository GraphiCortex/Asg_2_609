# BMEN 609 – Project 2: Computational Neuroscience Assignment

This repository contains the source code and simulation results for Project 2 of BMEN 609 – Computational Neuroscience. The assignment involves analyzing and simulating conductance-based neuron models using the Hodgkin–Huxley framework. The MATLAB code provided by the professor was converted to Python. The simulations include:

- **Question 1:**  
  - Examining the effects of temperature and Q₁₀ scaling on neuronal firing frequency and spike morphology.  
  - Extracting spike features such as interspike intervals and spike threshold determination.

- **Question 2:**  
  Progressive model development including:
  - **Part (a):** Baseline HH model simulation with Na⁺, K⁺, and L-type Ca²⁺ currents.
  - **Part (b):** Spike threshold extraction from the voltage trace.
  - **Part (c):** Incorporation of a Ca²⁺-dependent K⁺ (SK) current and analysis of its impact on firing frequency.
  - **Part (d):** Addition of a T-type Ca²⁺ current to study rebound firing under various parameter conditions.
  - **Part (e):** Extension of the model by adding a hyperpolarization-activated inward current (I_H) to modulate rebound responses.
